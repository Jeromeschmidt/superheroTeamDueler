# Superhero Team Dueler #

* Allows users to create their own teams of heroes, each with their own abilities, weapons, and armors, and battle them to see who is victorious!

* Simply use the command line interface to conduct battles and see who wins

* User can select if they want the heroes to be randomly paired up for battles for if they want tanks(those with the highest defense) to go first

* Each surviving hero receives an XP boost to reward heroes for winning

* 5 additional unit tests were created to further test functionality

* There is now a likelihood abilities, armors, and weapons  can be banned

* There is now a small probability that a team may be intimidated and run away

* There is a small possibility that an attack is negated
